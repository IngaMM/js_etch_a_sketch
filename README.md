A project of The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project

2. Open index.html with a browser.
3. Click the button "Create Grid" and enter the number of squares per side of the grid.
4. Press enter.
5. Draw with the cursor on the grid.
6. Click the button "Create Grid" if you want to start over again.

Discussion
I used the following technologies: HTML, CSS and Javascript.
This was a project to practise DOM-Manipulation.
The requirements were the following:
Create a webpage with a grid of square divs. Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for how many squares per side to make the new grid. Once entered the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before.
Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.

Bonuses
Instead of just changing the color of your grid from black to white (for example) have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value.
